# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- All buildable code lives in `web/`. Routes sit in `web/src/app`, reusable UI and theme helpers in `web/src/components`, and project metadata can be managed through Sanity CMS or `web/src/data/projects.ts`.
- Utilities, shared types, and static assets live in `web/src/lib`, `web/src/types`, and `web/public`. Treat `context-mds/` as the canonical history; append context rather than replacing it.
- Sanity CMS schemas live in `web/sanity/schemas/` and Studio is accessible at `/studio` route.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- From `web/`, run `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, and `npm start` (Node 20+ required).
- `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` mirror CI; run both before every PR.
- Configure `.env.local` with required environment variables:
  - **For contact form**: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`, `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL`
  - **For Google OAuth**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - **For Sanity CMS**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION`
  - See `context-mds/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` for OAuth setup and `context-mds/SANITY_CMS_SETUP.md` for CMS configuration.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use TypeScript React function components with explicit props, 2-space indentation, PascalCase components, and camelCase helpers.
- Tailwind plus CSS variables in `web/src/app/globals.css` drive theming—reference tokens such as `--primary` instead of hard-coded colors to keep palette switching reliable.

## Development Workflow
- Move work through the GitHub Project board (Backlog -> In Progress -> In Review -> Done) and keep tasks scoped to 1-2 focused days.
- All public references (nav icons, documentation) should use the primary account: `https://github.com/mfj-developments`.
- Branch per change (`feat/projects-drawer`, `fix/contact-errors`), push early for Vercel previews, and log noteworthy decisions in the relevant `context-mds/agent-*-context-*.md` file or `updates-plan.md`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Automated suites are pending; align with the roadmap by colocating new tests as `*.test.ts[x]` or Playwright smoke specs near the code they cover.
- Until that lands, rely on `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and manual QA of hero motion, theme switching, project filters, and contact happy/error paths. Record the steps and accessibility findings in PRs.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Write short, imperative commit subjects (for example `tune hero badges`) and keep diffs single-purpose.
- Reference the linked issue or Project entry, update the status column, and include validation commands plus screenshots or clips for UI PRs.

## Architecture & Configuration Notes
- `ThemeProvider` and `theme-controls` own palette state; reuse them instead of new global stores. Project detail pages rely on `generateStaticParams`, so update `web/src/data/projects.ts` and `web/public/images` together.
- `AuthProvider` (from `contexts/auth-context.tsx`) manages Google OAuth state globally; use the `useAuth()` and `useUser()` hooks to access user data in any component.
- Supabase client utilities (`lib/supabase/client.ts` for browser, `lib/supabase/server.ts` for API routes) handle session management via secure cookies.
- **Sanity CMS** provides content management at `/studio`. Query functions in `lib/sanity/queries.ts` fetch content. Use `getAllProjects()`, `getAbout()`, `getAllBlogPosts()`, and `getSettings()` for data fetching. Image optimization via `urlFor()` from `lib/sanity/client.ts`.
- Secrets belong in `.env.local` and Vercel project settings (root directory stays `web`). Sanitize any new API inputs following the `web/src/app/api/contact/route.ts` pattern and avoid committing sensitive files outside `web/public`.
