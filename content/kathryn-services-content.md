## FAQs

### Do you work outside of Northwest Arkansas?
Yes! While I'm based in NW Arkansas, I work with clients across Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, and beyond. Virtual design services are available for clients outside my local area.

### What's the difference between Interior Design and Production Design?
Interior Design Services are for homeowners creating their personal living spaces. Production Design Services are for builders, developers, and real estate professionals creating market-ready properties.

### How long does a typical project take?
Timeline varies by project scope. A single room refresh might take 4-6 weeks, while a full home design could take 3-6 months from concept to completion.

### Do I need to purchase everything you recommend?
Not at all! I provide options at various price points and work within your budget. For Design-it-Together clients, you have full control over what you purchase and when.

### Can you work with my existing furniture?
Absolutely! I love incorporating pieces that have meaning to you. We'll work together to blend existing items with new additions.

### What if I'm building a new home?
Perfect! The best time to involve an interior designer is during the building process. We can help with finish selections, lighting plans, and ensuring your new home is designed to function beautifully from day one.
