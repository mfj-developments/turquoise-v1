## Biography

Hi there! I am an interior designer and entrepreneur, and among the many things I love (coffee, yoga, red wine, the great outdoors, reading, writing, watering my plant babies, playing with my actual baby (okay he's nearly 8) playing music, spending time with my husband – to name a few) I most especially love helping people live happily in their homes! I believe for the happiest space, where we live and work should be extension of who we are, reflecting our personalities and telling our stories. So part of my job is helping people express themselves and tell their stories through their homes while we optimize the space to function at it's full potential! If you can't tell by now, I absolutely love my job. Getting to know my clients is one of the very best parts of the process, and I look forward to meeting you!
